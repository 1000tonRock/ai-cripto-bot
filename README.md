# ai-cripto-bot
Cryptocurrencies bot using machine learning

the file 'ia.py' is the principal bot, you need to use the 'neural.py' file to generate the trained data

The files 'bot.py' and 'parabot.py' are only used to suport the main file.

You can use the 'lucroCalc.py' to calculate the profit from the log file generated by the bot.

You can use the 'backtesting.py' to test the profit using old data from binance (ex.: last week candles)
